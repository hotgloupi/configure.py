tupcfg
======

**Configure your project for the [tup build system](http://gittup.org/tup/ "Tup home page").**

Motivations
-----------

  * Makefiles are slow and a pain to maintain.
  * AutoTools and CMake are huge pain.

Tup is by design one of the fastest build system, but as it is langage agnostic, 
it doesn't have a clue about library location, compiler version or any high level
system configuration. I initially solved this problem with dirty scripts for each 
project using Tup, and after getting tired of maintaining those scripts, I made up
this small project that saves me a lot of time.


Getting started
---------------

### Installation

Just drop the [configure](https://github.com/hotgloupi/tupcfg/raw/master/src/main.py) script
in the root directory of your project.

On unices, you could do:

    $ cd /path/to/your/project
    $ wget 'https://github.com/hotgloupi/tupcfg/raw/master/src/main.py' -O configure
    $ chmod +x configure

This script is written in python3, so you'll obviously need python3 on your computer. If the python
executable does not use python3, you may want to change the first line of the configure script. But
I would recommend that you set python3 as the default python version :).

The configure script will ensure that:
  * You have tup executable somewhere
  * the tupcfg python package is available

You can install yourself these two dependencies, or let the configure script install them for you.

    $ ./configure --self-install --tup-install

Note that same flags could be used later to upgrade tupcfg and tup.

You are now asked to manually edit the file `.config/project.py`, which defines your project rules.


### The project file 

The `.config/project.py` file must define the following function:

    def configure(project, build):
        print("Configuring build", build.directory)

This function is called for each build directory and is in charge of adding targets to the build.
For the purpose of this Getting started section, let's do a simple executable.

    from tupcfg.lang.c import gcc
    
    def configure(project, build):
        compiler = gcc.Compiler(project, build)
        compiler.link_executable('test', ['main.c'])

Assuming you have source file named `main.c` at the root of your project, for example:

    #include <stdio.h>
    
    int main()
    {
        printf("Hello, world!\n");
        return 0;
    }
    
You can now configure your project in a build directory `build`

    $ ./configure build
    Configuring build
    Just run `make -C build`

The first output line comes from our `configure()` function, while the second only appears
when a build directory is created. Now, your project should be something like that:

    $ tree .
    ├── build
    │   ├── Makefile
    │   └── Tupfile
    ├── configure
    └── main.c
    
    1 directory, 4 files
    
The makefile `build/Makefile` is generated for convinience by the configure script. 
It just call the `tup` executable, which is located in `.config/tup/tup` when installed
automatically. The `Tupfile` is generated by the `configure()` function (the compiler add targets).

As suggested, just run `make -C build` and enjoy the magic :)
